    <h1>Terms and Conditions for AI ChatWorks</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 03, 2025</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the <strong>AI ChatWorks</strong> browser extension (the "Service") operated by <strong>AI ChatWorks</strong> ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>

    <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>AI ChatWorks is a browser extension designed to enhance your experience with AI platforms. Key features include a Prompt Library, Cloud Synchronization, Ghost Text (autocompletion), and a Marketplace for sharing resources.</p>
    <p>The Service acts as an interface and utility layer over third-party AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by these third-party providers.</p>

    <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Registration:</strong> You may need to create an account to access features like Cloud Sync and the Marketplace. You agree to provide accurate and complete information.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> You are responsible for safeguarding the password and credentials used to access the Service. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</li>

        <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> Except where required by law, payments are non-refundable. You may cancel your subscription at any time to prevent future billing, but previous payments will not be refunded.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User-Generated Content and Marketplace</h2>

        <li><strong>Marketplace Usage:</strong> The Marketplace allows you to browse and download content to your personal library. Currently, users cannot upload or publish content to the Marketplace.</li>
        <li><strong>Downloaded Content:</strong> Once you download content from the Marketplace, you are free to modify and use it within your personal Prompt Library.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for the content you create or modify in your library. You agree not to use the Service to generate content that is illegal, offensive, or infringing on intellectual property rights.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties ("As Is")</h2>
